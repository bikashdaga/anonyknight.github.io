# Micro and Macro

## **Definition**

Micro architecture: All decisions can be made individually for each microservice

Macro architecture: All decisions can be made at a global level and apply to all microservices.

## Topics

* Division of domain logic: **D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               omain-Driven Design** and **Bounded context approaches**.
* How a DevOps model affects these decisions.
* Who divides the decisions into micro and macro architecture.

## Domain Driven Design & Bounded Contexts

**Domain-driven design (DDD)** offers a collection of **patterns** for the **domain model** of a system. 

Books:

[DDD book](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) 

[*Domain-driven Design Distilled*](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Distilled-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0134434420)

[*Domain-Driven Design Reference*](https://domainlanguage.com/ddd/reference/)

[Microsoft Domain Analysis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/domain-analysis)



Domain-driven design speaks of a **bounded context**. Each domain model is valid only in a bounded context.

The simplest design consists of **multiple specialized domain models that are valid only in a certain context**. 

**Domain events** between bounded contexts

## Architecture Decisions

### Micro and Macro architecture decisions

#### Programming languages, frameworks, and infrastructure

* Micro: technology for the specific problems can be used.
* Macro: only developers knowledgeable in some technologies can be hired.

#### Database: backup strategy, recovery strategy.

* Micro: Avoid global crash but higher effort to maintain
* Macro: Sharing DB contradict the bounded context. Even using a unified database, microservices need to have separate schemata in the DB.

#### UI

* Micro: different types of users with different requirements
* Macro: uniformed UI.

#### Documentation

* Micro: part of microservice handed over to another team
* Macro: Standardized documentation

### Typical Macro architecture decisions

* **communication protocol:** REST or messaging interface
* **Standardized data format**: JSON or XML.
* **Authentication**: Single authentication system. DC. Users **provide their identity.**
* **Integration**: run microservices together in the integration test.

### Typical micro architecture decisions

* Authorization: what a user is **allowed to do.** Vault? 
* Testing: domain logic, non-functional requirements: performance critical or safety-critical.

## Operation architecture

![operation-micro-vs-macro](./operation-micro-vs-macro.png)

* **Configuration**: technical parameters or domain logic. Password or certificates in Vault.
* **Monitoring**: technology that tracks metrics / the state of the state. ELK
* **Log Analysis**: Datadog, splunk, sumu logic. A server to receive and manage logs.
* **Deployment Technology:**  How the microservice are rolled out. Docker, Kubernetes pods, PaaS or installation scripts.
* **Macro architecture operation with separate operations teams**
* **Standardize only technologies**
* Testing the operation macro architecture
* “You build it, you run it”: operation as micro architecture

## Give a Preference to Micro Architecture!

### Macro architecture decisions: Best practices and advice

* Specifying only **a few points** in the macro architecture helps with focusing
* a macro architecture rule can ***define the monitoring technology***
* The macro architecture rules have to be **consequently enforced**.
* **independence** is an important goal of microservices

## Evolution of macro architecture

From restrictive rules into more languages and libraries.

## Organizational Aspects

* Uncontrolled growth
* Who defines macro architecture? 
* Independent architecture committee
* How to enforce? **document reasons for each rule.**
* Black-bot testing conformance.

## Independent Systems Architecture Principles

**[ISA](http://isa-principles.org/) (Independent Systems Architecture)** is the term for a collection of fundamental principles for microservices. 

## Conditions 

**Should** describes principles which have many advantages but **do not have to be strictly followed**.

#### 1: The system must be divided into modules with interfaces

#### 2: Two separate levels of architectural decisions

#### 3: Modules must be separate processes/containers/VMs

#### 4: Standardized integration & communication: RESTFul or messaging

#### 5: Standardized metadata: token or track ID. 

#### 6: Independent continuous delivery pipelines

#### 7: Operations should be standardized

- configuration
- deployment
- log analysis
- tracing
- monitoring
- alarms

#### 8: Standardized interface

#### 9: Modules have to be resilient with Asynchronous communication
