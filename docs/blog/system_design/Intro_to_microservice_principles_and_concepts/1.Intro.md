# Introduction

## Definition

* **Microservices** are independently deployable modules.

* every microservice has to be an independent process.

## Advantages

* Easy scalability of development
* Replacing legacy systems, replace the low perform python with go.
* Sustainable development. 
* Replaceability of microservices
* Dependencies have to be managed
* CD is easier
* More Robust
* Independent scaling.
* Free technology choice
* Security

## Challenges

* Increased operations effort
* Independently Deployable
* Testing must be independent
* Difficult to change multiple microservices
* Lost overview
* Increased latency and failures
* Weighing benefits and disadvantages
