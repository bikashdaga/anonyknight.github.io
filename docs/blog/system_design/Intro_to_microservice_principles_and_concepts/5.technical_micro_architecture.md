# Reactive Programming

The [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) defines the term “reactive” based on the following characteristics:

#### Responsive

- **Responsive** means that the system **responds as fast as possible**.

#### Resilient

- Because of **resilience** the system **remains available** even if parts fail.

#### Elastic

- The system can deal with different levels of load, for instance by using additional resources. After the load peak subsides the resources are freed again.

#### Asynchronous communication

- The system uses asynchronous communication (message-driven).

[reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) means something completely different. This programming concept resembles the data flow

## Reactive programming and the reactive manifesto

## [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

### Communication APIs

* REST - By default

* JAX RS API

* Java Messaging Service(JMS)
* [AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/) with [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) 
*  [Spring Cloud Streams](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/) supports messaging systems such as Kafka, RabbitMQ (see above) and [Redis](https://redis.io/).

### Operations

* Deployment - JAR file
* Configuration: application.properties
* [logs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-logging.html) or JSON data to server.
* Metrics: [Actuator](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.2.RELEASE/reference/html/production-ready.html)

## Go - Speed and concurrency

[Go vs. C: A Language Comparison of Concurrent Programming Features](http://dead10ck.github.io/2014/12/15/go-vs-c.html)

#### Communication: REST, [AMQP](https://github.com/streadway/amqp) , [Redis](https://github.com/go-redis/redis)

#### Operation

* Deployment: docker multi-staging
* Configuration: [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for both JSON and YAML
* [logs](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/log) 
* Metrics:  [Go Kit](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit), Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB

#### Resilience

resilience patterns such as [Circuit Breaker](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/circuitbreaker) ,  [Hystrix library](https://github.com/afex/hystrix-go)
