# Mobile Apps

## Strategy

* Mobile only

* Mobile first

* ### Mobile friendly - Responsive

* Generally, a responsive web page is divided into rows and columns containing grids. As the screen size gets smaller those grids rearrange themselves based on the screen size.

## Two approaches to design responsive websites

* Mobile first
* web first

Responsive interface: frontend

* [BootstrapJS](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
* [jQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/)
* Skyleton
* HTML5 Boilerplate
* Less Framework
