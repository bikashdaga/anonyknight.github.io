# More architecture

## Event Driven Architecture

**reactive programming** is a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming") [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm") concerned with [data streams](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing)> "Stream (computing)") and the propagation of change

*reactive* programming: a:= b+ c where a is automatically updated whenever b or c changes. In MVC, model changes will be reflected in an associated view.

## What Is Blocking?

*blocking* means the flow of execution is blocked waiting for a process to complete

## What Is Non-Blocking?

The ***non-blocking*** approach facilitates *IO Input-Output* intensive operations. Besides the disk & other the hardware-based operations, communication and network operations also come under the *IO* operations.

***CPU intensive* & *IO intensive***

### *Non-blocking* architecture is also known as the *Reactive* or the *Event-driven* architecture

Technologies like *NodeJS*, frameworks in the *Java* ecosystem like *Play*, *[Akka.io](http://akka.io/)* are *non-blocking* in nature and are built for modern high *IO* scalable applications.

They enable us to write code without worrying about handling *multi-threads, thread lock, out of memory issues* due to high *IO* etc.

**Node.js**

- Real-time applications (chat, feeds)
- Event-driven architecture
- Can perform client-server duties (e.g. serve files), but not well-suited for this
- Database management, testing tools, etc, available as additional packages

**Play**!

- Client-server applications (website, services)
- Share-nothing architecture
- Can perform real-time duties (e.g. Websockets), but not well-suited for this
- Database management (including migrations!), testing tools, etc, built into core
