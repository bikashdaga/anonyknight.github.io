# [CAP Theorem](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cap-theorem)

## 1. Consistency

## Week consistency

After a W, R may or may not see it.
VoIP, video chat, realtime
Memcached

## Eventual Consistency - Data is replicated asynchronously.

Highly available systems.
After a W, R will eventually see it.
Email or DNS.

## Strong consistency - transaction based systems.

After W, R will see it.

file systems and RDBMSes.

## 2. Availability

### Fail-over

### Active-passive (master-slave) failover

### Active-active (master-master) failover

Potential data loss

## 3. Replication

## 4. DBs

DB types:

* CP
* AP
* CA
