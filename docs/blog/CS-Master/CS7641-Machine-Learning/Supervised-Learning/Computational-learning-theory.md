# Computational Learning Theory

* Defining learning problem
* Show specific algorithms work
* show these problems are fundamentally hard

## Inductive Learning

* Probability of successful training
* Number of samples to learn
* Complexity of hypothesis class
* Accuracy to which target concept is approximated
* Manner in which training examples presented - Batch/online
* Manner in which training examples selected



## Selecting training examples

Teacher can ask 1 question to get the answer.

Learners need to eliminate as many as I can as a learner

### Steps

1. Show what's irrelabant.
2. Show what's relevant.

### Learn with Constrained Queries

### Learn with mistake bounds
