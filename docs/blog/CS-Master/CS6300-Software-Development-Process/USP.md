### Software process model
Order of phases, transition criteria.

### Component based
Software components
Well definied interfaces.

### Tightly related to UML
* notation
* Basic principles

### Distinguish aspects
* Use-case driven
* Architecture-centric
* iteractive and incremental.

## UML
### A use case vs a use case model
A use case model is a set of use cases.

### what are use case diagrams used for?
* Prioterize requirements.
* requirements elicitation
* test case design.

## Use-case Driven
A system performs a sequence of actions in response to user input.
Use cases capture this interaction.

## Architecture centric
* Use cases define the function
* Architecture defines the form.

## iteractive and incremental
* Give developers early feedbacks
* Mimize the risk of developing wrong system
* Accomdate evolving requirements
