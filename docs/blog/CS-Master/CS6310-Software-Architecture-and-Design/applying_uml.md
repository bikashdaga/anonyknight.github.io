## Part 1: introduction

### Ch.1 Object Oriented Analysis and Design(OOA/D)

Objectives:
#### What's the book goals and scope?

1. Interactive development process via an agile approach to Unified Process(UP)
   - How to create an excellent OO design?
  
    classic OO design metaphor: responsibility-driven design.
   - How to use the language for "software blueprints", displaying thought and the form of communication?
2. Introduction to OOA/D and Applying UML.
3. Focus on fundamentals: how to assign responsibilities to objects, UML notation, common design patterns.
   - principles, heuristics or design patterns(problem solution formulas for design principles)
   - **requirements analysis** related to **use cases.**
4. Intermediate level topics: framework design and architectural analysis.

In conclusion:

- Create better object designs by applying principles and patterns
- Iteratively follow common analysis and design activities, an agile approach to UP.
- Create frequently used UML diagrams.

#### How to define OOA/D?

**Do the right thing**
Analysis is to investigate the problem and requirements rather than a solution.
e.g. Requirements analysis or object oriented analysis.

In OO, analysis is to find and describe the objects/concepts in the problem domain.

**Do the thing right**
Design emphasizes a conceptual solution to fulfil the requirements rather than
its implementation.

In OO, design is to define software objects and how they collaborate to fulfill
the requirements.

#### Illustrate a OOA/D example

- Define use cases from requirements (Use case UML)
- Define domain model to show noteworthy domain concepts or objects. Domain model =
  conceptual object model. (Domain Model diagram for real-world classes)
- Assign object responsibilities and collaborations, draw interaction diagrams. (sequence diagram)
- Design class diagram to have a static view of the class. (software classes diagram)

#### What's the overview UML and visual agile modeling.

UML is a **visual** language to specify and construct, document the artifacts of systems.

At deeper level in Model Driven Architecture(MDA), UML notation is the UML meta-model.

Three ways to apply UML 
- As Sketch, informal and incomplete hand drawing on whiteboards.
- As Blueprint, reverse engineering to visualize and understand the code or code generation(forward engineering).
- As programming language, to generate the executable code.
