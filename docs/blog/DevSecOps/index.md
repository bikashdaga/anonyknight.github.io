## Why DevSecOps
> DevSecOps term is a relatively new term but given the rise in security awareness as well as breaches, it has become the talk of the town. Instead of having a team for manual security testing, it is way more efficient and cost/time effective to have automated security checks and catching the issue as soon as possible. This makes DevSecOps a highly demanded and regarded skill in the industry.
