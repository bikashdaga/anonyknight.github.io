## Problems

- How to validate the feature requirements?
- How to build confidence about our product?

## Testing Techniques

* Parametrized testing - Data Driven Testing

* Behavior Driven testing.


## Python

- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html)
- [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)

## Java Family

- [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [Spock for Groovy](https://spockframework.org/)
- [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium), Selenium IDE, Selenium Python Bindings.

## Dynamic Application Security Analysis (DAST) 
> The Dynamic Application Security Analysis (DAST) is performed to identify the possible run-time vulnerabilities or security issues. Unlike static analysis, dynamic analysis is performed on a running project.
