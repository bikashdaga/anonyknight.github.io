## Problems

- How to delivery products in public channels?
- How to manage those binaries?

## CI

[What's CI?](https://www.edureka.co/blog/continuous-integration/)

## JFrog artifactory

## CloudSmith

## [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)

- [Jenkins Tutorials](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jenkins/index.htm)

## [GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/)

## Why is it important in DevSecOps? 

> In the case of DevSecops, the CI  server triggers the security tools in different phases (e.g. Static Code Analysis, Dynamic Analysis, etc) and stores the logs/reports.  

## Software Composition Analysis

[What is Software Composition Analysis?](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/sca-software-composition-analysis)

### Tools
- [Retire.js: Finding Vulnerable Libraries](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/)
- [OSSAudit: Auditing Python Packages](https://github.com/illikainen/ossaudit)
- [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck)
- [Blackduck](https://www.blackducksoftware.com/)

## Compliance as Code(CAC)

### Why is it important in DevSecOps? 

> The Compliance as Code phase makes the compliance a part of the DevSecOps pipeline and ensures that on every release, the test server adheres to the security policies defined for the project. This reduces the attack surface and obviously helps with becoming compliance-ready.
