### Supervised Learning

The data points contain X and labeled Y.

**The goal** is to study many examples and make prediction.

1. discrete value called classification problem
2. continuos value - regression problem

e.g.

* Decision Trees
* Linear regression
* Bag

#### Bootstrap Aggregating

[Boosting and AdaBoost clearly explained](https://towardsdatascience.com/boosting-and-adaboost-clearly-explained-856e21152d3e)

### Unsupervised learning

**The goal** is to organize the data or to describe its structure.

1. Group data into clusters, K-Means
2. find ways to look at the complex data so that it appears simpler.

### Reinforcement learning

**The goal** is to choose an action in response to each data point.
(e.g. robotics or IoT: sensor data/signals to strategy for next action.)
