## Technologies:

*RabbitMQ*, *ActiveMQ*, *Apache Kafka*, ZeroMQ

## Case study: notification systems&Real-time feeds

**How to implement this notifcation system?**

They involve machine learning, understanding the user behaviour, recommending new relevant information & integration of other modules with them

### Pull-based approach
